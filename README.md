# City Run: Vice Delivery

A tiny GTA1-inspired Frogger-style browser game prototype.

[Play it here](https://moryoskorot.github.io/cursor-gta-frogger/)

This project was made in **one shot**, and I am **very pleased** with the result.
It literally took less than **2-3 minutes**, and it is already **enjoyfully playable**.
